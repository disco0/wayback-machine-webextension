# Wayback Machine Web Browser Extension

Welcome to the Official Internet Archive Wayback Machine Browser Extension! Go back in time to see how a website has changed through the history of the Web. Save websites, view missing *404 Not Found* pages, or read archived books & papers.

Most features work without requiring an account, but if you do create an account, you'll be able to archive any website easily with just a single tap of a button.

Some features must be enabled from Settings. Select *Private Mode* to prevent automatic sending of data.
